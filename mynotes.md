Got it! If the sale price is the same as in the stock, we can simplify the flow a bit more. Here's the updated structure:

### 1. **Sales Page Loads:**
   - **Fetch Stock Data:** On page load, get the stock details from the Stock Calculator (e.g., item names, quantity, and price).
   - **Initial Stock Display:** Show the initial stock in a tab with its quantity and price.

### 2. **User Input Sale Details:**
   - **Item List:** Display all available items from the stock.
   - **Quantity Sold:** Allow the user to input how many units are sold for each item.
   - **Total Sale Amount:** Automatically calculate the total sale amount as `quantity sold * stock price`.

### 3. **Update Stock:**
   - **Subtract Sold Quantity:** Once the user inputs the quantity sold, reduce the stock of that item.
   - **Remaining Stock Tab:** Update the remaining stock in a separate tab, showing the new quantity and total value (`remaining stock * price`).

### 4. **Save Sale Record:**
   - **Log the Sale:** Each sale will be logged in a separate record, tracking the sold quantity and total sale amount.
   - **Update Sale Log:** The app can display a log of all previous sales, which can be viewed later.

### 5. **Display Remaining Stock:**
   - **UI Update:** The Remaining Stock tab should show the updated quantities and total prices for items after each sale.

### 6. **Tabs Overview:**
   - **Initial Stock Tab:** Display the original quantity and price of each item.
   - **Remaining Stock Tab:** Display updated quantities and prices after sales.
   - **Total Sales Stock Tab:** Show the total sold quantity and value for each item.

This approach keeps the sale price consistent with the stock price and focuses only on tracking the quantity sold. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
